All,

Here is a web2py assignment while you are going thru web2py book.

Background
=========

Here is the example of DB Schema

Table Parent :

id, name
1, Bob
2, Alice
3, Mary
4, Peter

Table Children :

id,name, mother,father
1, John, 2,1
2, Jane, 3,4

Assignment
=========

When the table Children is displayed using grid - It should be shown as following on the Screen
name, mother, father
John, Alice, Bob
Jane, Mary, Peter

(Please do not report that "table is displayed in the grid" as status report. This part is very easy, is not the assignment.)

This (HTML) table should have an export functionality. The data should be exported as CSV file, but ....
The exported CSV file should contain the data as shown on the screen i.e it should contain the names of mother and father, not the IDs from Parent table.
